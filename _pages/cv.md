## Education

* Augest 2017 - present Tingshua University 

## Professional Experiences

* March 2019 -- June 2019: **Run machine learning experiments on lab servers**  Tsinghua University
  * Advisor: PhD Candidate [Xiufeng Huang](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab/?p=3649)
  * Considered distributed systems with multi-user machine learning tasks.My main job was to implement machine learning code on the GPU in the lab

* July 2019 -- March 2020: [**Distributed Coded Computation and Edge Learning**](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab/)  Tsinghua University
  * Advisor: Professor [Sheng Zhou](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/shengzhou/)
  * Considered network structure on the basis of distributed network.Proved that special network structure can effectively reduce the communication cost and reduce the influence of stragglers.Considered the minimum delay and minimum energy loss in a heterogeneous network with multiple base stations and multiple edge servers
  * Build a distributed computing architecture on amazon EC2 and conduct relevant experiments

* June 2020 -- September 2020: **Difference between Federated backdoor and centralized backdoor** UChicago
  * Advisor: Neubauer Professor  [Ben Y. Zhao](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/)
	* Compare federal backdoor attacks with centralized backdoor attacks.
	* Determine whether current defenses against centralized backdoor attacks are effective against federal backdoor attacks.

* July 2020 -- present : [**Coded Computation across eterogeneous Workers**](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab/)  Tsinghua University
  * Adivisor: PhD Candidate [Yuxuan Sun](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab/?p=2578)
	* Consider introducing a queue system based on heterogeneous coded computation across heterogeneous workers
	* Consider how much more computing resources data coding consumes

## Publications
